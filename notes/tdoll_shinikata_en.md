## Introduction

There is a unusual comment on wiki of [Gsh-18 (AKA 전지쟝, 감자)](https://namu.wiki/w/GSh-18(%EC%86%8C%EB%85%80%EC%A0%84%EC%84%A0)#s-7)

> "사망 모션이 특이하다. 이전 인형들은 쓰러질 때 표정이 `0.0` → `>_<` 이렇게 변하는데, GSh-18은 쓰러질 때 `0.0` 으로 변하지 않고 눈에 빛이 사라지며 죽은 눈이 되어 풀석 쓰러진다. 
> 완전히 쓰러질 땐 `>_<` 모양으로 변한다. 여태까지의 사망 모션과는 다르게 리얼해서 섬뜩하다는 반응이 나온다. "

> her heath motions is strange. she falls down with open `0.0` dead eyes, so it looks very frightened.

Hmm.. interesting.

## Death Scenes of T-Dolls 


Most cases, when a t-doll has been shot, there eyes were changed `o_o` and then finally 😖 `>_<` 


* Just one eye changed

* `o_o` to `>_<`

* Back or Face

Recent Chibis have almost the same actions (note: this document was written in 2019)

These scenes look like .. "[Aigo~](https://www.quora.com/In-Korean-what-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-aigo)" or "Ouch!" rather than [Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream)



### However Gsh-18 is different


she has a high quality death scene, why?

Gsh-18 skeleton data (Spine2d data) .. 

Someone made [dead-eyes](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%97%E7%9B%AE) images with alpha channels - only - for the "die" animation.

Eyes are change `>_<` , Of cources.



as upper links I mentioned , he or she remove final `>_<` data.

But their works not so good , so I tested them with chibi tools.

## Conclusion

- Being a mad scientist ? NO

- "dead-eyes" mod was about to be a new feature of spine-gif, the plan was cancelled.

- Currently I forgot how to mod it, so DO NOT ASK me how-to
